Hello my name is Gustavo!

In my past I was an Agronomic Engineer, Scientist and Musician and now I want to become a data scientist as my father was a great one! He taught me about computers since 1992, when we bought our first computer a 486 PC. I never wanted to follow his steps, but now I'm feeling I can be very good at that and my experience with nature science will give me a plus. Also I need a job and I have none at the moment.

I'll be thankfull for anyhelp.
